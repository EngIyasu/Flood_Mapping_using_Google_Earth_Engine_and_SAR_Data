# Flood_Mapping_using_Google_Earth_Engine_and_SAR_Data
This notebook presents the detection of flooded area over Khartoum, Sudan and its surrounding region from the overflow of Nile Rivers and heavy rains by utilizing Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired during dry and wet seasons of 2020. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies's (IFRC) report, the heavy rains (from middle July to August) and overflow of Nile Rivers (both Blue and White) have caused flooding, destruction of infrastructure, houses and livelihoods, and have displaced thousands of people in multiple locations across the country, primiarly in Khartoum and its surrounding area.
